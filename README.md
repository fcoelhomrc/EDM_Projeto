Interfacing with color sensor RGB TCS3200 and application in assistance to visually impairmered people.

Employing an ESP32 microcontroller and a color sensor, we built a web application for detecting colors and reading their name outloud. Using Micropython, we read the sensor output through digital frequency measurement, implemented a calibration routine, and used an external API (VoiceRSS) for text-to-speech conversion. 

This project was developed for the final evaluation in the course Digital Electronics & Microprocessors (2021-22) at University of Porto.
